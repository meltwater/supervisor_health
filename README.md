## Installation

The package can be installed as following:

  1. Add `supervisor_health` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:supervisor_health, git: "https://github.com/meltwater/supervisor_health", tag: "0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `supervisor_health` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:supervisor_health]]
    end
    ```

## Usage

In an application, e.g. a [Plug][elixir-plug] API, you could use SupervisorHealth like this:

    get "/_health" do
        case SupervisorHealth.health(MyApp.Supervisor) do
            {:ok, resp} -> send_resp(conn, 200, resp)
            {:error, resp} -> send_resp(conn, 500, resp)
        end
    end

## Responses

In general, the library will produce following 2 responses:

- `{:ok, response}` if everything is OK
- `{:error, response}` if any error occurred

The response contains information on any Supervisor child processes.

### Example

Using curl on the [Plug][elixir-plug]-based API mentioned above, a possible response could be:

    $ curl http://localhost:4200/_health | jq .
    {
      "internalProcesses": {
        "{:ranch_listener_sup, MyApp.Http.Router.HTTP}": {
          "status": "waiting",
          "stack_size": 9,
          "reductions": 175,
          "current_function": [
            "gen_server",
            "loop",
            6
          ]
        },
        "MyApp.Database": {
          "status": "waiting",
          "stack_size": 9,
          "reductions": 1136,
          "current_function": [
            "gen_server",
            "loop",
            6
          ]
        }
      },
      "health": "ok"
    }
